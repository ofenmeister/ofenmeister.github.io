  <p>Golf has definitely seen a lot of great players gracing the game namely Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Bobby Jones, but one player who stands apart from the others who have played the sport is none other than Tiger Woods. The now 41-year-old golf player and former World No. 1 is often considered by critics to be the most successful golfers of all time and has also been the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years.

During the 2000â€™s, Woods was a World-Beater and was almost untouched. From the period of August 1999 to September 2004 (264 weeks) and again from the period of June 2005 to October 2010 (281 weeks), Woods was the undisputed World Number 1 in PGA Official World Golf Rankings. He has been ranked Number Uno by the same ranking system for a record 683 week, an un-matched and unrivalled achievement.</p>
